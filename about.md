### About

We all know that Tesla vehicles are not designed to support Android, CarPlay or Android Auto. This project changes that by turning the browser into an interactive Android tablet that works when the vehicle is being driven. 

After six months of work first alpha version has been released. The main objective for this release has been simple: usability. For the project to scale and become popular in the Tesla community it needs to provide a responsive Android experience. Otherwise, people won't use it.

September 2022 marks another huge milestone for the project - version 2022.38.1 drops the two board requirement. All the essential software required has been migrated to run in the AOSP(Android Open Source Project) ecosystem. Several other bugs have been fixed as well. 
Hardware simplification helps in reducing both cost and entry barrier for less technical users. 

Everything is now on track towards providing a single image that can be flashed onto a Raspberry Pi easily like any other operating system. 

Next milestones for the project are all about making everything run faster. Hardware acceleration for video encode and decode will help in reducing the CPU load on the Raspberry Pi, achieving this would enable a more consistent performance combined with a decrease in power consumption.
